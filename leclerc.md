## 👤 Who is Charles Leclerc?

**Charles Leclerc** is a Monegasque Formula 1 driver competing for **Scuderia Ferrari**. Known for his talent, consistency, and charisma, Leclerc is a central figure in F1’s new generation.  
We chose him for this project because, despite his visibility and media presence, **Wikidata omitted a key aspect of his personal life**—his current relationship.

## 🧪 SPARQL Query: Finding Relationship Data

To compare relationship data across drivers, we ran the following query using `OPTIONAL` and `ORDER BY`:

### 📄 SPARQL Query

```sparql
SELECT ?driver ?driverLabel ?partner ?partnerLabel
WHERE {
  VALUES ?driver {
    wd:Q9673 wd:Q17541912 wd:Q112073790 wd:Q2239218
  }
  OPTIONAL { ?driver wdt:P451 ?partner . }

  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language "en". }
}
ORDER BY ?driverLabel
```

📎 **Result**: Charles Leclerc has **no recorded partner** in Wikidata, while Hamilton and Verstappen do. Antonelli has no data (likely due to age).
