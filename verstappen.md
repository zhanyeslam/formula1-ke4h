## üë§ Who is Max Verstappen?

**Max Verstappen** is a Dutch Formula 1 driver and reigning world champion, widely considered one of the most dominant athletes in modern motorsports. As the lead driver for **Red Bull Racing**, he has broken multiple records and secured consecutive world titles.

## üß™ SPARQL Query: Checking for World Championship Wins

We used the following SPARQL query to identify which of the selected drivers had won a Formula One World Championship.

### üìÑ SPARQL Query

```sparql

  }

  ?driver wdt:P2522 ?competition .

  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language "en". }
}
ORDER BY ?driverLabel

## ‚úÖ Corrected RDF (Manually Refined)

We reviewed the data and created the correct RDF:

```turtle
@prefix wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/> .
@prefix wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/> .

wd:Q2239218 wdt:P2522 wd:Q113628886 .  # Max Verstappen ‚Üí 2024 Formula One World Championship
```

Additionally, a more detailed RDF using qualifiers:

```turtle

@prefix p: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/> .
@prefix ps: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/> .

## üìå Conclusion

Although Max Verstappen is the confirmed 2024 champion, **Wikidata was missing this fact**.  
Using `VALUES`, `ORDER BY`, and `SERVICE` keywords in SPARQL, we identified the gap.  
With **Chain-of-Thought prompting**, we extracted correct facts from LLMs, though **RDF still required manual correction**.

This demonstrates that **LLMs can aid enrichment**, but **human validation remains crucial**.
