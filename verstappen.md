## ✅ Corrected RDF (Manually Refined)

We reviewed the data and created the correct RDF:

```turtle
@prefix wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/> .
@prefix wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/> .

wd:Q2239218 wdt:P2522 wd:Q113628886 .  # Max Verstappen → 2024 Formula One World Championship

## 📌 Conclusion

Although Max Verstappen is the confirmed 2024 champion, **Wikidata was missing this fact**.  
Using `VALUES`, `ORDER BY`, and `SERVICE` keywords in SPARQL, we identified the gap.  
With **Chain-of-Thought prompting**, we extracted correct facts from LLMs, though **RDF still required manual correction**.

This demonstrates that **LLMs can aid enrichment**, but **human validation remains crucial**.
