## üë§ Who is Lewis Hamilton?

**Lewis Hamilton** is a legendary British Formula 1 driver, widely regarded as one of the greatest in the sport's history. He is a **seven-time World Champion**, tied with Michael Schumacher, and has raced for McLaren and Mercedes for most of his career.

We chose Hamilton as a case study because of his **high visibility**, his **recent team change to Ferrari** (starting from 2025), and the **importance of having his Wikidata profile up to date**.

## üß™ SPARQL Query: Detecting the Gap

We ran the following SPARQL query to extract **nationality** (`P27`) and **team** (`P54`) information using a `UNION`, as required by the project. This helped us evaluate what is already in Wikidata.

### üìÑ SPARQL Query

```sparql
SELECT DISTINCT ?driver ?driverLabel ?infoLabel
WHERE {
  VALUES ?driver {
    wd:Q9673 wd:Q17541912 wd:Q112073790 wd:Q2239218
  }
  {
    ?driver wdt:P27 ?info .
  }
  UNION
  {
    ?driver wdt:P54 ?info .
  }
  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language "en". }
}
ORDER BY ?driverLabel
```

üìé **Result**: [https://w.wiki/EEnK](https://w.wiki/EEnK)

---

## ‚ùó Gap Discovered

From the query, we found that **Lewis Hamilton's recent move to Ferrari in 2025 is missing from Wikidata**. There is no triple like:

```turtle
wd:Q9673 wdt:P54 wd:Q10227 .  # Lewis Hamilton ‚Üí Scuderia Ferrari
```

---

## ü§ñ Zero-Shot Prompts to LLMs

We asked two different Large Language Models the same question:

> **Q:** What Formula 1 team is Lewis Hamilton racing for in the 2025 season?

### üí¨ Gemini Response

![Gemini Response](assets/images/Gemini_Lewis.png)

Gemini correctly identified that Hamilton joined **Ferrari** in 2025 after leaving Mercedes.

### üí¨ ChatGPT Response

![ChatGPT Response](assets/images/Gpt_Lewis.png)

ChatGPT also confirmed the move to **Scuderia Ferrari**, mentioning the ongoing contract until the end of 2026.

---

## üß± RDF Generation Attempt by LLMs

We then asked both models to produce **RDF triples using Wikidata ontology** to represent this information.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Initial Output (Incorrect)

Both models produced RDF with incorrect Q-IDs or structure:

![Another Wrong RDF Screenshot](assets/images/rdf_incorrect2.png)

---

## ‚úÖ Corrected RDF (Manually Refined)

After verifying and correcting the Q-IDs and structure, we manually constructed the **correct triple**:

```turtle
@prefix wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/> .
@prefix p: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/> .
@prefix ps: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/> .
@prefix pq: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/> .
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .

wd:Q9673 p:P54 [
  ps:P54 wd:Q10227 ;
  pq:P580 "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z"^^xsd:dateTime ;
  pq:P582 "2026-12-31T23:59:59Z"^^xsd:dateTime ;
  pq:P641 wd:Q1142852
] .

wd:Q10227 wdt:P31 wd:Q10842265 .  # Ferrari = instance of Formula One team
```

## üìå Conclusion

Using a simple SPARQL `UNION` query, we discovered that **an important fact about Hamilton's 2025 season was missing from Wikidata**.  
LLMs helped us retrieve the knowledge, but their RDF outputs required **manual corrections**.

This case illustrates both the **potential and limitations of LLMs** in knowledge graph enrichment.
