# Formula 1 Driver Knowledge in Wikidata

This project explores Wikidata entries of several Formula 1 drivers using SPARQL queries.  
As we retrieve data about their teams, achievements, and personal details, we identify where important facts are missing.  
To fill these gaps, we use large language models (LLMs) to generate reliable content, which is then converted into RDF triples.  
This approach helps improve the completeness and accuracy of the data using both structured queries and AI-generated knowledge.
